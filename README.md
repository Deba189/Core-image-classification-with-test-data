# Core-image-classification-with-test-data
The repository, ‘Core-image-classification-with-test-data’, provides a test dataset (Dataset 3 as detailed in the text), to verify the results obtained from the respective models. The test data is organised into train, validation and test folders, each with a set of 4 classes. This repository contains the set of codes and ouputs involved in the pre-processing steps, namely, to decipher class imbalance and calculate Jensen–Shannon divergence to understand data shift. This repository contains notebooks and outputs for the standard ResNet50 and ViT models and the two newly developed hybrid models (Attention Fusion (AF) and Simple Concatenation (SC)) as elaborated in the text. The codes have been written in jupyter notebook. A notebook and output have also been provided for the UMAP operation that is used in the assessment of model performance. 
The codes have been run on Python 3.10 and above. A GPU NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has been used in training and evaluation processes. The dataset and the notebooks provided herewith can be downloaded and results can be replicated in any device with a GPU with Python 3.10 and above. Re-running the notebooks might not produce the exact same results due to variability in GPU configurations.
